FRAMEWORK FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF INTERVENTION FACILITY FOR THE NATIONAL GAS EXPANSION PROGRAMME Nigeria is richly endowed with both energy resources, such as coal, tar sand, crude oil, petroleum and other derivatives of crude oil, natural gas, and various gas liquids and condensates. With proven gas reserves of 188 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas, the natural gas industry presents an opportunity to diversify the economy through domestic commercial utilisation of its natural gas. Historical non-viability of domestic commercial production and utilisation of gas continues to severely constrain private investments in the industry. Consequently, the low level of investment in the industry has resulted in the minimal production and utilization of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) as clean alternative sources of domestic energy in Nigeria. Failure to harness its gas resources has had negative consequences for the country – economic, environmental, fiscal and social, particularly as the industry has the potential to engender rapid growth in Nigeria’s non-oil economy. To this end, the National Gas Expansion Programme (NGEP) was introduced to make CNG the fuel of choice for transportation and LPG, the fuel of choice for domestic cooking, captive power and small industrial complexes. Equally, gas-based industries, most especially the petrochemical (fertilizer, methanol, etc) are to be enabled to support large industries, such as agriculture, industrial applications, textile and so on.  Therefore, as part of its efforts at stimulating finance to critical sectors of the economy, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) introduces the N250 billion intervention facility to help stimulate investment in the gas value chain. Large-scale projects under the intervention will be financed under the Power and Airlines Intervention Fund (PAIF), in line with existing guidelines regulating the PAIF, while small-scale operators and retail distributors will be financed by the NIRSAL Microfinance Bank (NMFB) and / or any other Participating Financial Institution (PFI) under the Agribusiness/Small and Medium and Medium Enterprises Investment Scheme (AgSMEIS).  The initiative is to be implemented in collaboration with the Ministry of Petroleum Resources (MPR).  This framework outlines the operational modalities for the intervention.
