 Outgoing CEO of GTBank (rumored to be the incoming chairman of GTBank Holdings), Segun Agbaje has splurged on a $180,000 Mercedes S560 Maybach edition in Magnetite Black Metallic colour. Converted to Naira, this vehicle costs a whopping N82 million and after shipping and Customs duty payments, would be well more than N120 million. The stunning Mercedes Benz motorcar with personalized license plates “S007” was spotted outside one of Lagos most expensive brunch café’s close to GTBank HQ in Lagos. S007 is a fitting name for the vanity plates, as even James Bond who uses an Aston Martin DB9 from time to time would be blown away by such a wonder on wheels as is the Mercedes Maybach.
