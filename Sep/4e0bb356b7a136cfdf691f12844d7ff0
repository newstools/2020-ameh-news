The Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Of The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) Professor Umar Garba Danbatta said to optimize the usage and benefit of spectrum, a number of initiatives such as spectrum trading, infrastructure sharing, satellite infrastructure and wireless infrastructure have been put in place to drive socio-economic development.  He pointed out that for instance, the transfer of the spectrum licence of 2X 10MHz in the 900MHz E-GSM Spectrum band from Intercellular Nigeria to Airtel networks Limited amounted to the sum of N8.9 billion. The amount generated through that singular initiative has brought significant revenue to Government.  EVC stated this in his speech at the interactive session with media chiefs and news editors on Friday recently in Abuja.  “The Commission has also remitted N362.34 billion from 2015 to date to the Federal Government Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF) through spectrum fees and operating surplus, which has helped to boost the revenue-generation drive of the current administration.  “It is interesting to mention that all the initiatives above have helped the Commission in identifying potential frequency bands to be harmonized for 5G deployment, which include26 GHz, 38GHz and 42GHz. Professor Danbatta noted that the last five years have been very exciting for me as the task of leading the regulation of a dynamic sector such as the Nigerian telecommunications industry presents enormous opportunities and challenges. The Nigerian Communications Commission appreciated media sayings the immeasurable support you (Media) have given to the Commission over the years in reporting our regulatory activities accurately, timely and adequately.
