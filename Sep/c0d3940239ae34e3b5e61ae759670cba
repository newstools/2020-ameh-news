 The Presidency has revealed that a COVID-19 survival fund from the government would be made available to potential beneficiaries as from next week.
This was disclosed by the Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity to the Vice President, Mr. Laolu Akande, when he appeared on Channels Television’s Sunrise Daily. He also repeated it at different times on Fresh FM radio station in Ekiti State, Bond FM, Radio One, and Metro Radio, all based in Lagos. According to him, the release of the survival fund, which would be realized through the active implementation of the Economic Sustainability Plan, is part of President Muhammedu Buhari’s administration’s plans to put money directly into the hands of Nigerians.
Mr. Akande noted that President Buhari prioritized the welfare of Nigerians and the survival fund was only one of the measures introduced to lift Nigerians out of poverty and reduce the pains and negative impact of coronavirus on the people.
Mr. Akande revealed that N2.3 trillion has been set aside to manage the economic fallouts of coronavirus and prevent the country from going into a deep recession.
While speaking on the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) supportive initiatives, Mr. Akande said, “Next week, we are starting the survival fund, which is a part of this plan. From next week, it will be available and people who are potential beneficiaries will be able to get more information on https://survivalfund.ng.”
He added, “As from next week, the website https://survivalfund.ng will be open for Nigerians who have MSMEs or who are artisans, plumbers, electricians, transport workers, private school teachers or who belong to different categories under the survival fund. (NewsBreakers)
