 The federal government has reminded all states of the federation to be vigilant in adhering to the safety protocols developed by the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID 19 ahead of the reopening of schools this week across the country. The Chairman PTF, Mr. Boss Mustapha, made the appeal yesterday when the task force briefed the media in Abuja. He said the fear of a likely surge in the pandemic should always put everyone on the toes, while warning that the stringent measures on schoolsâ€™ reopening announced by a number of countries, including Israel, should serve as warning signs for Nigeria and Africa. He also expressed delight that the latest numbers on COVID-19 coming out of Africa has revealed a flattening of the curve in the African region, which has seen a weekly decline in the number of new COVID-19 cases reported since the July 20, while number of deaths is also on a downward trend. While he noted that the country has progressively witnessed a decline in confirmed cases of the pandemic with a record low number of 79 cases on Sunday which, suggested that virus is under control, the SGF however said it is incumbent to improve the commitment to eliminate the virus completely by abiding with the safety protocols. He charged the public not to lose sight that the cautious approach adopted by the PTF has tremendously helped in the containment efforts, adding complacency we should be avoided at all cost. The federal government has vowed to descend heavily on travellers that fail to conduct the mandatory COVID-19 PCR test. It also explained its decision to ban some international airlines from coming into the country is not politically motivated. While Nigerians will get six- month passport suspension, foreigners face outright visa cancellation, it said. The Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 National Coordinator, Dr Sani Aliyu, disclosed this during the briefing.
