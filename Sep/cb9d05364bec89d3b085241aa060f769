Kogi State Internal Revenue Service (KGIRS) on Friday said its action to seal off all the Union Bank of Nigeria (UBN) branches in the state was in line with the Judgment of the State High Court. The Director, Legal Services, KGIRS, Barr Isa Jamil disclosed that on the 21st of August, 2020, the High Court of Kogi State granted an application of the KGIRS to seal off the premises of Union Bank of Nigeria PLC on the account of her default in the payment of tax liability owed Kogi State Government in the sum of One Hundred and Forty Seven Million, Three Hundred and Forty Three Thousand, Four Hundred and Seven Naira Thirty Two Kobo (N147, 343,407.32). Jamil further explained that UBN on its part filed a counter motion before the Kogi High Court, seeking to set aside the Order. According to him, the Court heard the application on the 26th of August, 2020 and in a well considered ruling, dismissed it for lack of merit. Jamil added that in 2019, UBN had filed a case before the Tax Appeal Tribunal (TAT) sitting in Jos disputing KGIRS assessment notice of the same liability but on the 29th of July, 2020 the TAT found UBN liable to Kogi State Government in the sum of N147, 343,407.32 and directed the bank to pay the said amount immediately. UBN however, failed to comply with the Judgment. Jamil said the seal off of the premises of the bank will continue until the liability of the bank is fully settled. He however hinted that the state is also looking at other lawful options to ensure that the liability is settled by UBN without further delay.
