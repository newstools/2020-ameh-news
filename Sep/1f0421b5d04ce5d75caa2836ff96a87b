The Executive Vice Chairman (EVC) and Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Professor Umar Garba Danbatta stated this at The Interactive Session with Media Chiefs and News Editors recently in Abuja. Professor Danbatta disclosed that the in 2015; broadband penetration in Nigeria was less than 6%. Nevertheless, we have an impressive 42.02% in broadband penetration as at July, 2020.  This achievement, according to EVC, is as a result of key policy initiatives to improve broadband penetration embarked upon by the Commission. These include increasing the number of licensed Infrastructure Companies (InfraCo) to six across the geo-political zones, spectrum refarming, spectrum re-planning, spectrum auctions, and administrative spectrum assignments, among others, he added.  He noted that the Commission is presently in the process of finalizing the six Infraco’s counterpart funding agreement to ensure the full rollout of broadband infrastructure on an Open Access Model (OAM) and this will ensure there is Point of Access in each of the 774 local governments in the country.  “The increase in broadband penetration has enabled the growth of the subscriber base which was 199,307,796 as at June 2020.  “Through diligent implementation of each of the elements of the agenda, has significantly and measurably improved digital access and deepened broadband penetration thus expanding the frontiers for a truly national digital economy.  Teledensity has risen to 104.41 while the percentage contribution to GDP in Q2 2020 was 14.2%.  The NCC is working with the Nigeria Industrial Policy and Competiveness Advisory Council (Critical Infrastructure Sub Committee) under the auspices of the Vice President, Yemi Osibanjo GCON, on various initiatives towards improving Broadband Penetration.
