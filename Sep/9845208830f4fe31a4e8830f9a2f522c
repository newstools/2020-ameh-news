The management of Zenith Bank Plc has released its audited accounts for six months of 2020 through the Nigerian Stock Exchange to the investing community, which showed that the bank recorded strong earnings growth over the corresponding period of the prior year. The results showed the EPS stood at N3.30 which translated to 16.6% greater than 2019.The directors and board has proposed an interim dividend of N0.30 per share be the same to N0.30 per share 2019, which equates to a yield of 1.7% based on the closing price of N17.20 as of the 3rd of September 2020. Other indicators recorded are: Interest income which grew by 1.1% year on year to N216.95 billion, supported primarily by the income from loans and advances to customers grew by 11.6% year on year to N128.37 billion as risk asset creation has been strong in the year so far at13.8% Year To Date to N2.62 trillion. The other contributory line recorded a decline is investment securities to 18.1% year on year. The decline in income from investment securities was expected, as yields across assets have pared significantly from the prior year. Also, interest expense declined by 17.4% year on year to N59.55 billion, reflecting lower interest cost on borrowings over the corresponding period of the prior year declined to 50.7% to N17.00 billion and despite the increased cost on deposits from customers grew to 13.3% to N42.54 billion. Consequent to the decline in interest expense, net interest income settled higher by 10.5% year on year at N157.41 billion. After accounting for credit impairment charges hits 74.2% year on year to N23.92 billion, net interest income settled at 3.7% higher year-on-year. The exponential growth in LLE is in line with our expectations, given the application of the ECL model and the expected impact of the pandemic on the bank’s risk asset quality both at present and going forward. Continuing the trend during the year, non-interest income (NII) was strong, settling 6.2% higher year on year at N116.49 billion. The strong growth recorded was supported by expansions in FX revaluation gains at 239.6% year on year to N22.02 billion, and gains on investment securities by 30.4% year on year to N58.83 billion. This expansion in NII, alongside the growth in net interest income, led to an expansion in operating income of 4.8% year on year to N249.97 billion. Other indicators are Operating expenses growth was moderate, as the bank continued to focus on cost management in the face of moderate gross earnings growth. And Opex grew by 7.1% year on year to N135.85 billion, with the most pressure exerted by other operating expenses stood at 16.6% year on year to N21.22 billion such as Information Technology, and maintenance costs. Consequent to the Opex growth relative to operating income growth, the bank’s cost-to-income ratio settled higher at 54.3% relative to 52.7% and 50.9% in the prior quarter and the corresponding period of the prior year. Also, profitability was stronger, with profit-before-tax settling 2.2% higher year-on-year. However, profit-after-tax settled 16.8% higher year-on-year, on account of a 54.8% decline in income tax expense. When contacted, experts at Cordros Research said: the bank’s macro-prudential ratios remain strong, as all ratios settled within statutory limits. The bank’s non-performing loans ratio improved to 4.7% from 5.0% in the prior quarter, although this may be adduced to the significant year to date expansion in loans to customers, as well as regulatory forbearance for distressed restructures. Similarly, the bank’s capital adequacy stood at 20.0% while liquidity recorded 43.8% ratios remained strong after expanding quarter on quarter and signifies that the bank has ample headroom for growth over the medium-term. Also, we note that the bank’s current loans-to-deposits ratio stood at 66.1% is now above the minimum LDR of 65.0%. In our view; the bank’s performance was well above our expectation, as the much reduced tax expense supported a stronger expansion in profitability. Save for that the performance of key lines remains within our forecasts. We expect core income growth to remain weak, although overall performance should be stronger as non-funded income expands due to FX revaluation gains.
