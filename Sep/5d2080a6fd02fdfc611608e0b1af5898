 The federal government has scheduled another meeting today with members of the organised labour movement in a bid to prevent a looming mass action being planned by the leadership of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and Trade Union Congress (TUC). The two labour bodies had threatened to commence nationwide industrial action and protest along with their civil society allies starting from Monday, September 28 to compel the government to reverse the recent rise in the price of petrol and electricity tariffs. A statement signed by the Deputy Director (Press) in the Ministry of Labour and Employment, Mr. Charles Akpan, said the Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige, would be hosting the meeting at the Banquet Hall, of the Presidential Villa in Abuja.
