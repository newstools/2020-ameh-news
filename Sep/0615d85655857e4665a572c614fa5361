The management of Access Bank has released its six Months operations earnings in 2020 through the Nigerian Stock Exchange to investing community, which revealed that the bank operational recorded a marginal decline in profitability. The results showed the Earning Per Share at N1.73 representing 8.9% negative as against previous year, nevertheless the bank’s directors and board has proposed an interim dividend of N0.25 per share compare with N0.25 per share 2019, which equates to a yield of 3.9% based on the closing price of N6.40 as of the 3rd of September 2020. The other indicators bank recorded are: interest income decline of 9.6% year on year to N246.72 billion in the period, pressured by the decline in income from investment securities which stood at 31.4% year on year to N74.00 billion. The decline in income from investment securities was expected given increased capital allocation to risk asset creation given the CBN’s LDR policy, as well as the precipitous decline in yields on assets from the prior year. This decline was steep enough to offset growth in other contributory lines, as income from loans and advances to customers showed positive 0.3% year on year to N160.61 billion and banks  at 7,598% year on year to N6.72 billion, as well as cash and balances with banks at 11.5% year on year to N5.39 billion all expanded over the period.  Others are: Interest expense expanded moderately over the period, advancing by 2.3% year on year to N120.52 billion, with the most pressure exerted by interest on deposits from financial institutions, which rose by 48.8% year on year to N34.07 billion, and offset the declines from deposit from customers which stood at 11.6% year on year and while debt securities stood at 31.3% year on year. The bank seems to have now optimised its deposit base and is taking advantage of the synergy with Diamond bank, as cost of deposits declined by 27.9% from the fourth quarter 2019 stand alone period to the second quarters 2020 period. While there was a moderate growth in expense on deposits from customers’ quarter on quarter in second quarters 2020 at 4.2% positive, the run rate would still be well below expense in 2019 Financial Year Ended.  However, the results showed non-interest income grew by 194.5% year on year to N138.85 billion, supported by strong growth in income from investment securities at 3,152% year on year to N134.84 billion, primarily driven by derivative instruments, which offset the substantial FX revaluation loss recorded at 988.7% year on year to N57.6 billion.  Furthermore, operating expenses increased substantially during the period by 40.0% year on year to N174.29 billion, given the effects of the consolidation with Diamond bank. Consequently, all major contributory lines recorded spikes, with regulatory charges – AMCON levy grew to 56.5% year on year to N35.44 billion and NDIC premium  increase to 28.8% year on year to N7.54 billion, while personnel expenses  stood at 16.0% year on year to N36.25 billion leaving other expenses to 49.2% year on year to N77.70 billion all expanding. Given the significant year-on-year expansion in operating expenses, the bank’s cost-to-income ratio (after accounting for LLEs) deteriorated to 70.1% from 66.1% and 55.0% in the previous quarter and corresponding period of the prior year, respectively.  The head to head analysis revealed the growth in income relative to expenses, which bank recorded a profit before tax growth of 1.8% year on year to N74.31 billion, while Profit After Tax settled at 1.4% lower year on year at N61.03 billion, given the higher income tax expense of 19.7% year on year.  When contacted experts at Cordros Research Comment Saying: The bank’s performance was generally in line with our expectations. The quarter-on-quarter deterioration reflects the impact of the slowdown in economic activities; however, 2020 Financial Year Ended performance is still expected to be fair, supported by non-core income growth.
