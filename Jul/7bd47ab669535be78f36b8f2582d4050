 Public school teachers in Ogun State yesterday listed conditions Governor Dapo Abiodun must meet before reopening schools. They demanded provision of Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs), infrared thermometers, hand sanitisers, among others before reopening schools. The Chairman of the Nigeria Union of Teachers (NUT), Comrade Titilope Adebanjo, speaking to reporters at the union’s secretariat in Abeokuta, said the conditions must be met before schools could be reopened. He cited other conditions given by the NUT as disinfection of school premises, provision of running water, alcohol based sanitisers, training of teachers on how to use the thermometers and standby health workers within a kilometre radius of each public school. Governor Abiodun last Friday declared that schools and worship centres should remain shut for another 14 days following increasing COVID-19 infection rate.
