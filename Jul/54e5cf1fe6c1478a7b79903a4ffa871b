The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN)’s Economic Review for second half of 2019 report released in Executive Summary format over the week revealed that in recent times, particularly with the privatization of the power sector, more attention has been given to   electricity supply to the industry leading to marginal improvement in the country in terms of hourly supply and number of outage per day.  In the report says Since the first half of 2018, electricity supply from the distribution companies to the sector has stabilized at 10 hours per on the average just as power outage stabilized at 3 times daily.   The report further disclosed that the resulting from the marginal improvement in electricity supply to the sector, expenditure on alternative energy in the second half of 2019 declined to N34.70 billion from N49.92 billion recorded in the second half of 2018 but increased from N32.68 billion in the preceding half.  In the same vein, the World Manufacturing Sector Performance appraisal by UNIDO, disclosed that the World manufacturing has experienced a consistent decline in production growth, indicating an overall economic slowdown, which results in job losses, fall in consumer demand and a deterioration of living standards.   “This downward trend continued in the fourth quarter of 2019, as manufacturing output growth fell below the landmark of 1 per cent and remained at 0.7 per cent, following a growth rate of 1.1 per cent in the third quarter of 2019.   According to UNIDO report, the overall decline in growth in the year 2019 is primarily influenced by tariffs and trade tensions between the world’s most dominant economies, namely the United States, China and Europe.   “The widespread slowdown is observed in nearly all regions and country groups, whereas major industrial economies, in particular, such as Germany, Japan or the United States suffered reductions in manufacturing output.
