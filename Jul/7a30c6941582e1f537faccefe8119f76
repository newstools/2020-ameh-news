Nigerian Shippers’ Council has been inundated with complaints against shipping companies/agencies, seaport terminal operators and off-dock terminals on the arbitrary levy of container demurrage, storage and transfer charges on innocent consignees, for transportation of cargoes to off-dock terminals unilaterally initiated by terminals without the consignees’ consent. It should be noted that based on international standard and recognised practice, freight paid at origin covers movement of cargo to final port of delivery at destination. It follows therefore, that cargoes earmarked for transfer to off-dock terminals, at the request of the shipping company, seaport terminal operator or off-dock terminal, without the consent of the consignees or their authorized representatives, should not attract charge(s) against the consignees. In a statement endorsed by RakiyaZubairu, Head of Public Relations of the council saying Nigerian Shippers’ Council considers this act as unethical and unwholesome. Accordingly, Nigerian Shippers’ Council has resolved that all service providers must be guided as follows:  Consequently, all transfer charges collected from consignees of cargoes transferred from seaport terminals to off-dock terminals, from 1st June 2020 to date, at the instance of the shipping companies/agencies, seaport terminal operators or off-dock terminal operators, without the consignees requesting for such transfer, must be refunded to the consignees immediately. Failure to refund such charges will lead to the Council invoking its regulatory powers to enforce compliance.
