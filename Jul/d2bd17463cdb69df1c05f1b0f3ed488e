 The Federal government on Friday declared the first Niger Bridge between Onitsha and Asaba is not in any way collapsing. The government’s reaction was sequel to the alarm raised by Nollywood Actor, Yul Edochie, who claimed the Bridge was shaking and may collapse in a social media post. Federal Controllers in charge of Anambra and Delta States, Adeyemo Ajani and Moshood Jimoh, explained nothing was wrong with the bridge in terms of its structural stability. They told reporters that Messrs. Setraco Construction Co. Ltd carried out extensive repairs and maintenance of bridge between years 2005 – 2006. They said the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing awarded the emergency repairs of the bridge to Messrs. Matiere-Johnson Consortium Ltd on 6th August 2013 with an extended completion date of 31st December 2019. Conducting reporters round the bridge through Onitsha and Asaba ends, Ajani said the existing Niger Bridge was a steel Bridge of 1.4km length across the River Niger linking Anambra and Delta States. He maintained the government had not, in any way abandoned it, adding that very soon the new asphalt over lay would be done on the bridge. Ajani further said the bridge had fixed and rocker bearings to allow for longitudinal thermal movement. He disclosed there were five basic types of support structure for bridges, adding the vibration was normal as it was designed like that. He noted the first Niger bridge was designed to function on roller supports, which he said acted at angular movements. Jimoh, on his part, said the bridge was not designed to carry static loads.
