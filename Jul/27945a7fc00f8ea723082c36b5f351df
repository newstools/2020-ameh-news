 Suspected Boko Haram insurgents on Wednesday evening attacked the convoy of Borno Governor Babagana Zulum. The incident, according to a terse message by a member of the Governorâ€™s convoy, took place between Monguno and Baga town when the Governor was on his way to distribute food to displaced persons. Though details of the attack are not yet clear, The Nation gathered no casualty was recorded. The Monguno and Baga axis of the state has been completely cut off from mobile telephone services as the insurgents have destroyed all the facilities. Zulum on Monday travelled to Monguno to continue his statewide distribution of food to displaced persons in the area and assess some of the communities ahead of the planned return of some of the IDPs to their ancestral home.
