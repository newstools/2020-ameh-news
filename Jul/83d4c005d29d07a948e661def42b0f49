The Nigeria Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) says the Nigerian international airspace has not been closed till October 2020 as being insinuated following its issuance a 3-month duration NOTAM (Notice to Airmen) from 15th July to 15th October 2020, stating that the federal government has extended the closure of the nation’s airports to all international flights with the exception of aircraft in a state of emergency. In a statement signed by Mr. Khalid Emile, NAMA spokesman and obtained by THEWILL, the agency explained that following the receipt of an All Operators Letter (NCAA/DG/AIR/11/16/152) from Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority, NCAA, the agency issued an Aeronautical Information Circular (AIC) titled “Phased Resumption of Domestic Flights” on 7th July 2020 to the effect that Lagos and Abuja airports will open for domestic flight operations on 8th July, Kano, Port Harcourt, Owerri, Maiduguri and Uyo opens on 11th July and all other airports on 15th July 2020.  It further explained that paragraph 9 of the AIC states that “The closure of Nigerian Airports to all international flights with the exception of emergency and essential flights, and scheduled cargo operations with approved summer schedules, will continue until a date of resumption is approved, adding that for the avoidance of doubt, the agency on the 15th July 2020, in line with international standards, issued a 3-month duration NOTAM (Notice to Airmen) from 15th July to 15th October 2020, stating that the Federal Government of Nigeria has extended the closure of the nation’s airports to all international flights with the exception of aircraft in a state of emergency, however approval may be requested and granted to:  “From the foregoing, there was no indication that the closure of Nigerian airports to international flights was from 15th July to 15th October 2020. However, the NOTAM was issued for a minimum duration of 3 months in view of the fact that a specific date for resumption of international flights has not been confirmed by the Honourable Minister of Aviation nor the Director General of NCAA.
