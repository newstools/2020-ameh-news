The first trial among more than 1,000 adults in Britain found that the vaccine-induced “strong antibody and T cell immune responses” against the novel coronavirus. A separate trial in China involving more than 500 people showed most had developed widespread antibody immune response. The studies, published in The Lancet medical journal, constitute a major step on the road towards a COVID-19 vaccine that is effective and safe for widespread use. The authors of the studies said that they encountered a few adverse side effects from the vaccine candidates. However, they cautioned that more research was needed, particularly among older adults, who are disproportionately at risk of dying of COVID-19. Co-author Sarah Gilbert from the University of Oxford said the results “hold promise”. “If our vaccine is effective, it is a promising option as these types of vaccine can be manufactured at a large scale.”
