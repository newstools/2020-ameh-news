 FLIGHTS and commercial activities will resume at the Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu, Enugu State, on August 30. The airport was closed on August 24, last year for the rehabilitation of the runway and upgrade of other infrastructure to meet international standards. The government had initially fixed April as its reopening date but blamed the delay to deliver on schedule on the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and the raining season. Aviation Minister Hadi Sirika confirmed yesterday that the project was 90-95 per cent ready. Sirika, who was at the airport to inspect the progress of work yesterday, said: “We wanted to make a quick intervention in this procurement to ensure that the once dilapidated runway that was a threat to the safety of our operations have been dealt with. “We were on course but unfortunately COVID came and the workers took to their heels to ensure that they remain safe. We are back on site and we have made a tremendous amount of progress. “We are about 90 to 95 per cent completing this job. However, the final wearing course is where we are on the runway while the perimeter fencing and the road is going on and other works including airfield lighting for day and night operations and for it to truly answer its name – Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu.” He continued: “The season now is the rainy season and just like COVID, the rainy season is also a monster in the procurement of this nature but the contractor, the consultants are doing extremely well and the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) who is a client and I am happy with the progress of work. I am very confident that this procurement will be delivered on the 30th August 2020.
