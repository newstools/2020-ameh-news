He explained that several countries have not opened up for international flight operations and that Nigeria has not received clearance to fly to countries who are already receiving foreign visitors. “On the question about when we are beginning international travels, certainly you are very aware that so many countries had placed a ban on countries that we cannot go even from Nigeria. “Also Nigeria, of course, will place a ban on other countries that cannot come in here. Everyone is trying to keep safe,” he said. “These and many other reasons will make us be cautious and study some more and liaise with stakeholders to decide when we will open international flights. “Within the sector, we want to reopen because we are bleeding and losing money but we have to remain alive first before we make money. Whatever decision we take has to be in the interest of humanity in general.” The minister also said consultations would also have to be carried out with the World Health Organisation, the Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS) and other aviation stakeholders
