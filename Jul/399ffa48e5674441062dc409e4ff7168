 Nigerians have been warned not to abandon the safety regulations and protocols for the prevention of COVID-19 during the forthcoming Eid-El Kabir festival. Boss Mustapha said the warning became necessary considering the urge to want to gather for prayers, especially by muslims. He said infection has no respect for festive seasons. Mustapha, who is the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) He spoke in his capacity as the Chairman of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 Control, commended governors who have issued warning in their states. He urged others to borrow a leaf from the ones that had cautioned against gathering, warning the most vulnerable, especially the old and those with underlining illnesses, to be most careful. Mustapha said: “We also have cause to begin to advise Nigerians on the upcoming Eid-El Kabir Festival. This naturally comes with lots of mass gatherings but we must not forget that the guidelines are still in existence and the virus is very potent. “We urge all State Governments to ensure that guidelines are adhered to and citizens should not indulge in activities that would allow for the spread of the virus and lives are endangered. “We are encouraged by State Governments that have announced ban on Sallah Festivities and hope it will be upheld and replicated by other States. The National Coordinator will also amplify on these issues.” He said the PTF plans to restructure its modes of operations and rely more on technology rather than promoting physical contacts. The measure, he said, became inevitable as members of the task force were becoming exposed. He cited the COVID-19 positive status of Foreign Affairs Minister Geoffrey Onyema, who is also a member of the task force.
