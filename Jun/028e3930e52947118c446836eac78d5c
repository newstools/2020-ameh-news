 The Economic and Financial Crimes Commision (EFCC) yesterday said it would probe alleged cases of diversion of COVID-19 funds. The commission said President Muhammadu Buhari had authorised the anti-graft agency to go after anybody no matter how highly placed. EFCC Acting Chairman, Mr. Ibrahim Magu, warned against embezzling funds and items donated to contain the pandemic. Magu warned that “monies and items for palliatives as a result of COVID-19, which are being diverted, will be thoroughly investigated and those found wanting will be prosecuted.” Magu, who spoke at a briefing to commemorate Democracy Day, noted that the commission placed premium on both enforcement and prevention strategies.
