 The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has hailed the Federal Government for the planned reopening of worship centres. CAN described the development as victory over the dreaded Coronavirus (COVID-19), pandemic. Special Assistant (Media &Communications) to CAN President Pastor Adebayo Oladeji said: “We want to get the details before we will react fully. But in the interim, it is a welcome development. It is our prayers that God will surely deliver Nigeria from the pandemic in Jesus Name. “If Christians and Muslims return to their worship places to pray for victory over COVID-19, God will surely answer us. The closure of the worship places is not acceptable to God. We thank God for opening the eyes of our government to the reality”.
