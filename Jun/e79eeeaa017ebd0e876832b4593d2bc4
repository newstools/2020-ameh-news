 WHO has also declared Nigeria polio-free, leaving the devastating disease endemic in only two countries of the world, Afghanistan and Pakistan. However, a renowned virologist and Chairman, Expert Review Committee on Poliomyelitis Eradication and Routine Immunisation, Prof. Oyewale Tomori has said the country must continue to vaccinate children against the virus until the remaining two affected countries in the world are declared free. In a tweet to announce the feat yesterday, the WHO Nigeria @WHONigeria, said the country had completed documentation for wild polio virus-free status, and that the documentation has been accepted by the African Regional Certification Commission for polio eradication. Sharing his thoughts on the feat, Tomori, who has been one of the scientists at the forefront of addressing the disease in Nigeria, said: “As long as there are other countries of the world with the virus, Nigerians must continue to vaccinate our children.”
