Top Nigeria’s import nations  China – 26.28% Netherlands – 11.14% USA – 10.45% India – 7.92% Belgium – 6.11%  Implication for Nigeria’s economy  The latest report shows that Nigeria has maintained its negative trade balance since Q4 2019, meaning the country importing more than exporting, consequently affecting the country’s foreign reserve.  A decline in the export of manufactured goods is an indication of the country’s low industrial and manufacturing industry.   Despite the increase in Agricultural export, there was also a recorded increase in the import value as well, which directly contradicts the essence of border closure as a measure of discouraging importation.  It is expected that the Q2 2020 report will give a full reflection of the effect of COVID-19 and lockdown procedures on Nigeria’s trade balance.  Note that during the lockdown, ban was placed on international travel by most countries which would affect our export capacity.  Also, medical supplies and ventilators used in isolation centers in Nigeria were not manufactured in Nigeria, consequently affecting the country’s trade balance.  In the same vein, some of major banks’ loans to customers merely increase to N18.9 trillion in Q1 2020, up from N17.4 trillion in FY 2019  Research revealed a 5.74% increase during the first quarter of the year leads banks’ loans growth by more than N1 trillion during the first three months of the year.  The breakdown details of major ones shown: Zenith Bank Plc recorded the biggest loans to customers in Q1 2020, having disbursed as much as N275.2 billion worth of loans during the period.

Check Below for others banks’ figures:   Why this Matters: Recall that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had in July 2019 increased banks’ Loan to Deposit Ratio (LDR) to 60%, up from 58.5%. Three months afterwards, the LDR was again increased to 65%, even as speculations were rife that it would further be increased to 70%. The apex bank later issued a circular announcing that LDR would be retained at 65% which is the current level.  The main reason the CBN increased the LDR in the first place was to facilitate the provision of credit facilities to the real sector of the economy. The CBN incentives assigned a weight of 150% in respect of lending to SMEs, retail, mortgage, and consumer lending. Lenders are required to fully comply or risk attracting a levy of additional Cash Reserves Requirements of 50% of the lending shortfall of the target LDR.  Insider revealed that the apex bank’s LDR policy was partly responsible for the noticeable increase in banks’ loans to customers in Q1 2020. However, it remains to be seen whether the loan figures will grow during the second quarter of the year, considering the challenges that have faced the Nigerian economy during the period.
