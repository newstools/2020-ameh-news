 The Emir of Katsina has called for the establishment of military barracks and cantonments in frontline local government areas of the state to tame the insecurity.
He said the existing barracks could not serve the population of the war front and nearby local governments in circumstances that require rapid response. The emir, while hosting Buratai in Katsina, stressed the need for urgent actions to be taken to establish the barracks to further enhance the security of the areas.
In the past month, more than 200 people have been massacred and scores kidnapped in fresh onslaughts orchestrated by bandits in frontline LGAs of Faskari, Dutsinma, Danmusa, Safana, Batsari, Sabuwa, Jibia, Kankara, Dandume. The renewed attacks have forced thousands of residents of the affected local governments who survived the deadly invasions to flee their ancestral homes to the headquarters of the council areas, including Katsina, the state capital. Usman said: “These frontline local government areas are vulnerable to banditry and kidnapping due to low-security presence. So, the establishment of the military barracks or cantonments will assist greatly in ending insecurity facing my people there.” According to the monarch, it is the sole responsibility of government to protect the lives and property of its citizens.
While lamenting the banditry in communities across the state, the emir said traditional rulers would continue to support the military to eliminate the bandits.
