FMDQ Securities Exchange Limited (FMDQ Exchange or the Exchange) is pleased to announce the approval of the quotation of the Dangote Cement PLC ₦34.00 billion Series 15 and ₦66.00 billion Series 16 Commercial Paper (CP) notes under its ₦150.00 billion Domestic CP Issuance Programme on the Exchange’s platform. This comes on the back of note-worthy debt issuances on the Exchange, including the recently quoted Flour Mills of Nigeria ₦30.00bn CP notes, Sterling Bank ₦15.00bn CP notes and the United Capital ₦5.32bn CP notes, amongst others.
