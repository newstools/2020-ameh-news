 The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) yesterday stated that it would be suicidal for schools to be reopened by the federal government amid the COVID-19 pandemic. ASUU has also kicked against any appointment and promotions carried out under what it described as the illegal Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS). The union said the government must make resources available in order for schools to meet proposed conditions by the Federal Ministry of Education. ASUU National President, Prof. Biodun Ogunyemi, made this position known while speaking with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ota, Ogun State. He urged the government to provide the ideal environment and meet the conditions spelt out by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) before reopening schools across the country. Ogunyemi said: “The federal government must lead and show the ways by meeting the conditions for reopening of schools before any school can be allowed to open because COVID-19 pandemic is a health challenge. “When it comes to public health, it is something that should not be left in the hands of individuals but the federal government must take the lead.” The ASUU president listed the conditions spelt out by NCDC to include the provision of materials for regular hand washing, provision of face masks, isolations spaces and hands sanitisers. He said many government-owned schools did not have the financial capacity to meet the outlined conditions. He said: “It is suicidal to reopen schools now if the federal government itself could not meet the conditions spelt out by the NCDC and the World Health Organisation. The nation will expose innocent children to avoidable risks.” Schools across the country were shut in March to curb the spread of the pandemic.
