 The federal government has disclosed that 80 per cent of the parents across the country are against the reopening of schools, and has however, promised to announce the new date for the resumption of domestic flights by next week. The government has also expressed worry over rising cases of COVID-19 in the country, with Cross River State also recording the first case of the virus. It has also disclosed that the report of the National Agency on Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) on the Madagascar herbal drug is ready. This is coming as the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr. Boss Mustapha has said that he would impose a fresh lockdown on the country if it was within his power to do so. Speaking yesterday in Abuja during the press briefing by the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19, the Minister of State for Education, Mr. Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba revealed that 80 per cent of the responses from parents that followed a perception survey conducted across the country by the ministry, said they were opposed to any hurried reopening of schools to experiment with their children. “We are keeping the children at home because you can’t see coronavirus with your naked eyes and can’t know if a child is asymptomatic, carrying the virus. If he does and he goes back and infects another person, there is no way for us to know. ‘’Prior to that, the ministry carried out a perception survey around the country and 80 per cent of the responses were assurances from parents that they’re not willing to experiment with their children. If there are parents willing to experiment – to check whether it can work or not, we can invite them to a test,’’ Nwajiuba said.
