 The federal government has also expressed the confidence that the nationwide strike by resident doctors will be called off in a few days. Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, at the PTF media briefing, said most of the issues of concern were being trashed out.
Ehanire also spoke on measures being promoted by government in order to prevent increase in deaths arising from COVID-19. He said the increasing number of new cases of COVID-19 in the country should serve as a warning that fatalities could be on the rise if certain health precautions were not taken. According to Ehanire, since the majority of fatalities are over 50 years of age, or have preexisting ailments like diabetes, cancer, hypertension, kidney disease, HIV, such group of citizens has to be specially protected.
