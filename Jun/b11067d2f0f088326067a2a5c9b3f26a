 The federal government, through the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), has banned non-travellers from the airports and also directed persons coming to pick up arriving passengers to remain in their cars until travellers exit airports’ entrances. FAAN made this known yesterday as part of the new protocols for the resumption of flights amid the COVID-19 pandemic. FAAN, in a tweet, said: “Non-travelling passengers will not be allowed into the airport terminal buildings. People coming to pick up arriving passengers are advised to remain in their cars until passengers exit the gate. Stay safe.” FAAN also urged travellers to wear face masks, maintain two metres distance and arrive at airports at least three hours before flights to ensure proper checks. The federal government had stated that cvil aviation authorities would determine the resumption of domestic flights in the country.
The National Coordinator of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, Dr. Sani Aliyu, had on June 1 said that “the aviation industry is requested to start developing protocols to allow for domestic flights to resume anytime from June 21 onwards.”
