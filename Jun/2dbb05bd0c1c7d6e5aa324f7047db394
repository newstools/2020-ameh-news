 Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, yesterday unveiled new operational guidelines for the police and other law enforcement agencies on COVID-19 prevention enforcement duties.
The guidelines are also expected to deal with emerging incidents of gender-based violence. The IG said in Abuja that the guidelines were necessitated by the increase in reported cases of domestic violence, rape, defilement, cybercrimes, among others linked with the COVID-19 restrictions. “These unfortunate incidents have prompted the introduction of these operational guidelines, which will help to adequately coordinate and reshape the conduct of personnel of the force and other law enforcement agencies on the frontline of operations in the enforcement of the COVID-19 prevention orders. “It will also serve as a standard code of conduct for police officers in similar operations in the future,” he said.
The IG directed the Assistant Inspectors-General of Police and Commissioners of Police in zonal and state commands as well as heads of police departments and formations to make the guidelines subject of departmental briefings and lectures. He said the operational guidelines would also serve as a training manual in all police training institutions.
“Consequently, the IG has also ordered the strengthening of the Gender-Desk Units and the Juvenile Welfare Centres (JWCs) across the country and the deployment of investigative assets to deal with gender-related offences.
“In addition, the cybercrime unit of the force has also been strengthened to deal with cybercrimes connected with the COVID-19 pandemic,” he added.
