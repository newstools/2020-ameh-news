 The House of Representatives has resolved to come to the rescue of Benue State’s coronavirus disease index case, Mrs Susan Idoko, who has accused the government of refusing to release her from isolation despite not been infected. The move by the House followed the unanimously adoption of a motion moved by Mrs Blessing Onuh at the plenary on Tuesday. Adopting the motion, the House resolved to “mandate the National Centre for Disease Control, through the Federal Ministry of Health, to critically evaluate her as a matter of urgency and if proved otherwise, should be allowed to go home.” The House also advised against stigmatisation, inhumane treatment and violation of human rights of COVID-19 patients. Moving the motion, Onuh said, “The House notes that one Mrs Susan Idoko-Okpe, nee Lawani, a 56-year-old woman who is an indigene of Benue State with a dual citizenship from the United Kingdom, flew into the country for her mother‘s funeral on the 22nd of March this year. Unfortunately, she got quarantined by the government for the COVID-19 virus, an assertion backed up by discrepancies in the laboratory results. “The House is aware that Idoko-Okoe had a long flight following her departure from the United Kingdom and must have had jet-lag, a common occurrence which necessitated her presentation to the Cottage Hospital where she was primarily managed. “The House is disturbed that the details of this ldoko-Okpe is not consistent with that of the lady who was referred from the Benue State Teaching Hospital Makurdi to Gwagwalada Specialist Hospital, Abuja.” The lawmaker added that the personal information on the laboratory result from the NCDC did not also tally with her personal details. According to Onuh, the lady has also been forced to take treatment for COVID-19 even in her asymptomatic state.
