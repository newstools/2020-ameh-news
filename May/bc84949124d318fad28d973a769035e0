 The Nigerian Shippers’ Council has called on freight forwarders charged demurrage fees by shipping lines from March 30 to May 3 to come forward for refunds. Recall that the NSC had met with the Shipping Association of Nigeria in April and agreed that demurrage should be suspended during the lockdown. Our correspondent gathered that while majority of the shipping lines had issued notices to their affiliates in Nigeria and importers informing them of the suspension of demurrage during the period, others had continued issuing debit notes to freight forwarders for demurrage charges. In a statement signed by its Head, Public Relations, Rakiya Zubairu, NSC stated, “It has come to the notice of the management of the council that some freight forwarders and shippers have difficulties with regard to the issue of refund of demurrage charges and are still billed despite the suspension. “Such persons are encouraged to contact the council through the help lines and e-mail addresses published on the NSC website and other social media handles.”
