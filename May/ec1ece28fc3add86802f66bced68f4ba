A staff of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) at its Burma Road headquarters in Apapa have been reported to have contracted the Coronavirus . Reliable sources disclosed that the staff with office at 3rd floor belonged to the Maritime Labour department and that he was usually in charge of conducting the usual Muslim prayers at NIMASA. According to the source, the official whose identity was not mentioned has since been taken to the Nigerian Centre for Decease Control (NCDC) Yaba Lagos for treatment.  Speaking, the stakeholder who was apprehensive said the NIMASA Apapa headquarters was thrown into panic mode on Tuesday when the news broke about the COVID-19 case. Since then, he said that many staff, including visiting stakeholders have been avoiding the 3rd floor for fear of contracting the virus.  “Do you know how many people he might have shook hands with? The man may not even know that he has it before it became too late” he said  Efforts to confirm the development from the NIMASA media spokesman,  Mr Philip Kayenet proved abortive as calls to his phone were not picked while text messages were not replied.  In further efforts to confirm from other staff of the media department was futile as at time of this report.  In the same vein, it was disclosed that the APM Terminals Apapa staff that contracted the Coronavirus has been discharged.  The staff (names withheld) was a crane operator at APM Terminals and according to sources; he was not symptomatic before testing positive to the decease.
