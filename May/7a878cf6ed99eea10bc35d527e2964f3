To access the N100bn loans provided by the Central Bank of Nigeria for firms in the healthcare sector, a corporate entity must submit its application to a participating financial institution which could be either a Deposit Money Bank or a Development Finance Institution of its choice with a bankable business plan. The CBN recently introduced the N100bn credit intervention for the healthcare industry as part of its measures to cushion the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the economy. It stated in its latest guidelines that the PFI must appraise and conduct due diligence on the application; and upon approval by the PFI’s credit committee, the application would be submitted to the apex bank with relevant documents attached. The CBN would process and disburse funds to the PFI for onward release to the project, it added.
