 In another development, the Northern State Governors Forum has lamented that the region now accounts for about 54 per cent of the national cases and 70 per cent of new infections of the virus in Nigeria. This was the resolution of the forum at its fourth teleconference meeting held yesterday to review the region’s COVID-19 response, and deliberate on other matters relating to its progress and development. The resolution was made available to journalists in Jos by the Director of Press to the Chairman of the Forum, Governor Simon Lalong, Mr. Simon Macham.
Lalong appreciated President Muhammadu Buhari’s military intervention to tackle banditry in the region. On the profiling and evacuation of Almajiris, the forum observed that so far, there had been appreciable progress as many states had transferred Almajiris to other states and also received their citizens without any problem. They resolved to continue with the exercise by strictly following laid down protocols for their profiling, quarantining, testing, transportation, handling, and taking over as well as reintegration. On enforcing closure of interstate boundary roads, the governors again expressed disappointment that despite several measures that had been taken, including presidential orders, there were still violations in this regard, where people move from one state to another through compromise and use of illegal routes.
