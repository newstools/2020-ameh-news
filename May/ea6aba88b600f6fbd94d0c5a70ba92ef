 The federal government has directed stranded Nigerians in Thailand to pay the sum of N297, 600 for their quarantine, isolation, and accommodation centres or hotels before their departure and arrival in Nigeria. The federal government, through the Nigerian Embassy in Thailand stated this in a memo dated May 14, 2020, which was sent to the stranded Nigerians, warning that any prospective evacuee that refuses to pay would not be evacuated.
