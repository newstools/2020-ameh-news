“Reigniting the SPARK of Human Kindness Embedded in All of Us”  The management of the First Bank of Nigeria Limited has said that 2020, many would argue, has been the most challenging year for this generation, but – and let’s never be in a hurry to forget or wave this aside – it has been the year that has offered this same generation the most opportunity yet to act humanely, to reach beyond one’s self and one’s own hurts and disappointments and challenges to extend comfort and kindness to those around one. The report further noted that the humanity’s response to COVID-19 and outreach to those most vulnerable to the disease and its impact, have been most commendable.  According to the statement endorsed by Folake Ani-Mumuney, Group Head, Marketing & Corporate Communications of the bank and sent to the AmehNews, saying long before COVID-19 and our award-winning response to mitigate its challenges, FirstBank had introduced several Corporate Responsibility & Sustainability (CR&S) initiatives in line with the Bank’s nation-building strategy such as SPARK (Start Performing Random Acts of Kindness) which has touched the lives of over 80,000 people including students and underprivileged widows; impacted over 50 charities and NGOs; reached over 100 million people in 8 countries.  In addition, we contributed to Junior Achievement Nigeria (JAN) target of impacting one million students in the over twenty years partnership in driving the next generation of Nigerians to collaboratively create the dream of a bright and innovative future for Nigerians, the report said.   “Our goal is to reinforce our CR&S agenda while on the sustainability journey. As 2020 has shown, when challenges confront us, they do not rob us of our humanity or our ability to act humanely. Rather, challenges present us with an opportunity to dig deep within us, to the very core of our being from where the milk of human kindness flows.
