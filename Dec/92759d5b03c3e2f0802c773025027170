 The Police and the military yesterday narrated how 80 pupils of Hizburrahim Islamiyya School in Mahuta village of Dandume Local Government Area of Katsina State, who were abducted by bandits on Saturday, were rescued, saying they achieved the feat after a gunfight. The Islamic pupils were said to have been abducted while returning from Maulud celebration at Alkasim village of the local government area on Saturday night. The abduction came barely a week after another group of bandits kidnapped 344 pupils of Government Science Secondary School Kankara, Katsina State on a day President Muhammadu Buhari arrived in Daura, his hometown in the state, on a week-long private visit. The Kankara pupils, who were released last Thursday, were brought to the Government House, Katsina on Friday where Governor Aminu Masari presented them to the president.
However, governors elected on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), have called on security agencies to reinforce their capacity to protect lives and property.
