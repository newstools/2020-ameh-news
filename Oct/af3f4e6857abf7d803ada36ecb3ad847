The stakeholder consultative forum is important to the government as it provides the opportunity “to bring all the stakeholders on the same page for effective implementation of the NNBP 2020-2025,” adding that the achievement of the targets in the plan needs the support and full engagement of all stakeholders.L-R: Ayuba Shuaibu, Secretary, Universal Service provision Fund (USPF); Dr. Adebayo Adewusi, Director General, Nigeria Postal Services (NIPOST); Dr. Aliyu Abubakar, Director General, National Identity Management Commission (NIMC); Dr. Abimbola Alale, Managing Director/CEO, Nigeria Communications Satellite Limited (NIGCOMSAT); Dr. Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, Minister of Communications and Digital Economy; Kashifu Abdullahi, Director General, National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA); Prof. Umar Danbatta, Executive Vice Chairman, Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC); Ubale Maska, Chairman, Broadband Implementation Steering Committee (BISC) and Olusola Teniola, President, Association of Telecoms Companies of Nigeria (ATCON) at the stakeholder forum on Monday. Addressing the forum, the Executive Vice Chairman of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Professor Umar Danbatta, said the Commission is embarking on necessary regulatory measures to actualize the targets in the national broadband policy. At the first stakeholders’ consultation with the industry players held under the auspices of the Ministry in Abuja on Monday October 19, 2020, it was disclosed that there is need for collaboration between the public and private stakeholders to achieve the national target of 70 per cent broadband penetration, as provided in the NNBP.

The Commission will continue to facilitate necessary regulatory measures for the deployment of fibre infrastructure to all parts of the country, which is crucial for pervasive broadband penetration that we are all working to achieve,” Danbatta said. He stated that while steady progress has been made with 54,724, kilometer of fibre so far deployed across the country, spirited efforts are being made by the Commission not only to increase this milestone in fibre infrastructure but also ensure their maximum protection by working with the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA) to stem the spate of infrastructure vandalism. Industry stakeholders led by the President of Association of Telecoms Companies of Nigeria (ATCON), Engr. Olusola Teniola, advocated the need for buy-in by the operators and key stakeholders in the broadband vision and implementation drive of the government. Earlier in his welcome address, the Chairman, Broadband Implementation Steering Committee (BISC) and Executive Commissioner, Technical Services at NCC, Ubale Maska, stated that the main purpose of the consultation is to present the key provisions of the new national broadband plan in terms of its set targets, pillars, recommended initiatives, implementation timelines, responsibility matrix, governance structure and the various roles expected to be played by all stakeholders in the implementation of the plan, especially the key industry players. The programme was attended by CEOs of agencies under the Ministry and representatives of telecoms companies.
