The Management of the GT Bank Plc, in the first quarter of 2020 earnings results released yesterday to the capital market community through the Nigerian Stock Exchange (The NSE), which was in line with expert’s expectation.  The performance, according to the experts was supported by moderate growth in both interest and non-interest income, alongside industry-best efficiency. Also, the bank proposed a final dividend of N2.50 per share, which translates to a dividend yield of 11.0%, based on the last closing price of N22.70 as at March 2, 2020.  The breakdown of the results shown interest income grew by 3.4% y/y in Q1, 2020 to N77.04 billion, supported by growth in income from loans and advances to customers increased by 6.1% y/y), and also investment securities growth by 8.2% y/y), both of which masked declines across interest income from cash declined by 57.3% y/y), also loans to financial institutions shown 97.7% y/y) declined indication and assets pledged as collateral declined by16.5% y/y). According to the report, the bank posted strong growth recorded in risk assets up by 8.1% YTD to N1.62 trillion, and follow shortly is the investment securities which growth by10.3% YTD to N1.02 trillion were responsible for the acceleration in interest income from those lines.  On the other hand, interest expense pared by 21.6% y/y to N12.75 billion, despite an increase in deposits by 9.4% YTD to N2.77 trillion, as the bank has seemingly continued to improve it’s CASA (low-cost deposits: current and savings accounts) mix during the year, in the face of an expectation of soft interest income growth. Consequent on the strong balance sheet management, net interest income growth was strong, expanding by 10.4% y/y to N64.28 billion.  Non-interest income moderated in the period, settling 1.1% y/y lower at N34.92 billion, with major lines recording declines save for gains from FX revaluation which up by 220.3% y/y at N8.45 billion. While NII may be weaker in the year, given revised charges and weaker transaction flows occasioned by the global pandemic. For us, the positive impact of revaluation gain should more than offset the weaknesses in NII. Given the growth in interest income, and despite the exponential growth in loan loss expenses up by 87.8% y/y to N1.22 billion, the bank recorded an expansion in operating income of 5.5%y/y.  The report showed the bank carrying operating expenses which expanded by 10.9% y/y to N39.77 billion, with the most pressure exerted by regulatory charges with AMCON levy gulp an increase of 11.2% y/y to N8.59 billion and NDIC premium growth by 17.8% y/y to N2.38 billion. Consequent on the OPEX growth relative to operating income growth, cost-to-income ratio (ex-LLE) settled higher at 40.6% relative to 38.6% in the corresponding period of the prior year. Consequently, profitability was stronger, with profit-before-tax settling 2.1% higher year-on-year, while profit-after-tax settled 1.6%.  Comment: according to group of experts at Cordros Research with capital market research knowledge over ten decades has stated that as expected, the bank recorded a muted performance in Q1,2020. . From the numbers posted above, experts have started to see the impact of much increased risk asset creation, which has also affected LLEs. Experts are expecting pressure on that line in 2020, even without significant NPLs growth, given regulatory forbearance expected due to the impact of COVID-19 on the economy. Nonetheless, over all they expect the bank to record a decent performance in the year, supported by non-core earnings (FX revaluation gains).
