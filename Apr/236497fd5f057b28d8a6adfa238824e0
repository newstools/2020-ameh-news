 The National Information Technology Development Agency on Wednesday inaugurated a Virtual Learning Academy. The academy, expected to provide Nigerians in various sectors with the opportunity to access digital education and skills, was inaugurated during a virtual event. Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Pantami, who inaugurated the academy, said already more than 12,000 Nigerians had enrolled for virtual learning programmes. Pantami noted that many activities, including governance, would now be conducted online as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The minister explained that the academy would provide free courses that could lead to certification from CISCO, Oracle, Huawei and Havard among others. Pantami added that plans were underway to hold future Federal Executive Council meetings virtually through the academy. However, he noted that the plan would have to be approved by the President. “We are working to conduct the Federal Executive Council meetings virtually, particularly, if there is a critical issue; the President will go online and conduct a meeting virtually,” he said.
