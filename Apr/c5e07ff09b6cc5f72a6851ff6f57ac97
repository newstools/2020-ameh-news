The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board has received over 4,000 online enquiries from candidates and the public over the recently conducted Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination. The board received the complaints on its online platform within days when the President, Major General Muhamadu Buhari (retd,) imposed the lockdown on Abuja, Lagos and Ogun states, as a result of the spreading coronavirus pandemic in the country. About 1.9million candidates sat for the 2020 UTME which held from Saturday, March 14, to Sunday, March 22, across 666 Computer-Based Test centres nationwide. The board had on March 24 announced that it had closed its offices nationwide due to the spreading coronavirus pandemic, urging the candidates and the general public with enquiries and complaints to visit its online platform. In its weekly bulletin obtained on Sunday, the board noted that it had received over 4,000 complaints within days of the lockdown on the 2020 UTME and resolved the cases. JAMB said, “The board has taken advantage of technology, particularly as related to the institution of a ticketing platform, to address candidates’ enquiries during this period of lockdown as over 4,000 cases have been resolved without any physical contact between staff and candidates. “Perhaps it would be expedient to state that the facility for change of programmes or institutions has been activated while results are ready for printing but these processes have been put on hold because the presidential directive mandating citizens to stay at home is still in force. “As soon as the COVID-19 pandemic is over, the printing of result would be enabled. The introduction of the ticketing system in 2018 was to address the challenge of candidates crowding the board’s offices, engender transparency by way of tracking complaints, provide conducive atmosphere for candidates seeking correction of data and ensure that necessary feedback is obtained from candidates.”
