The organisation said in a statement yesterday that contrary to the theory, COVID-19 is a respiratory disease which is spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks. “People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface and then their eyes, mouth or nose,” it said. WHO added that COVID-19 is spreading in many countries that do not even have 5G mobile networks. It also said being infected with the coronavirus does not mean that the person would be infected with the virus forever, adding that people recovered from the disease. “Most COVID-19 infected persons can recover and eliminate the virus from their bodies. “If you are infected by the disease, make sure you treat your symptoms. “If you have cough, fever and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early, but call your health facility by telephone first. “Most patients recover, thanks to supportive care,” WHO said. It added that exposure to the sun or to temperatures higher than 25C degrees would not prevent COVID-19. “You can be infected with COVID-19, no matter how sunny or hot the weather is. Countries with hot weather have reported cases of COVID-19,” the organisation noted. It said to be protected from the virus, people should ensure frequent and thorough hand washing and avoid touching the eyes, mouth, and nose
