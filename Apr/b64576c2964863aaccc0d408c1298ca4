 West African leaders under the aegis of ECOWAS Authority of Heads of States and Governments, yesterday appointed President Muhammadu Buhari as Champion of the COVID-19 Response to, among others, lead the region’s campaign for debt forgiveness. Buhari’s appointment, according to Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, took place at the Extraordinary ECOWAS Summit on COVID-19 held through teleconferencing and chaired by the President of the Republic of Niger, Mahamadou Issoufou. African leaders have been forceful in their demand for a debt relief in view of the economic disruptions triggered  by the pandemic, which  have undermined the income streams of many countries. However,  with the uncertainty surrounding how soon the virus would be defeated,  many blocs within the continent have  stepped up their preparations to rally support  for the clarion campaign for a debt relief.
