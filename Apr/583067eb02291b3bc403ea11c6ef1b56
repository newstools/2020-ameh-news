 Community leaders in the Niger Delta have warned against attacks on the National Security Adviser, Babagana Monguno, who is now overseeing the Niger Delta Presidential Amnesty Programme following the suspension of Prof. Charles Dokubo as coordinator. The Niger Delta leaders, under the auspices of Forum of Progressive Niger Delta Leaders, condemned what they described as smear campaign in the social media to discredit the NSA and the caretaker committee constituted by the Federal Government to manage the amnesty programme. In a statement by its President, Chief Akpakpakiri Amakamu; and Secretary, Chief Kpokoye Morris, the FPNDL said peddling unfounded allegations against high-ranking government officials and respected individuals was criminal, counter-productive and portrayed the Niger Delta people in bad light. It said, “These blatant lies sponsored and recycled over time by self-styled leaders of the Niger Delta who hold the erroneous belief that the amnesty programme is their source of livelihood, should be stopped forthwith. “It is unfortunate that they have gone a step further by dragging the names of respected top government officials in the mud in their desperation to be appointed coordinator of the amnesty programme. “We shall expose them henceforth if they continue on this ignoble path. The recent allegation is a dangerous and wicked lie calculated at splashing mud on the NSA. “General Monguno is a highly respected, disciplined and incorruptible military officer with impeccable and enviable records as the Chief of Defence Intelligence, Commander, Brigade of Guards and Defence Attaché, among other top flight positions he held in a career that spanned over three decades. He is reputed to abhor corruption and cannot encourage fraudulent practices.”
