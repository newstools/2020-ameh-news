One of our staff at Ports & Cargo Terminal, Tin Can Island Port, Lagos, has tested positive to COVID-19, after unwittingly coming in contact with a family member, who had tested positive to the virus. The staff was asymptomatic as at Friday, April 17, 2020, the last day he was in the office. When he realized the said family member, who is his father-in-law, had tested positive, he decided to isolate himself and stayed away from the office. It was during his isolation that he developed the symptoms and was eventually diagnosed with the virus. He, alongside his wife and children, who have also tested positive, are currently undergoing treatment at the Landmark Isolation Centre, Victoria Island, Lagos. As a responsible organization, immediately the affected staff called to officially inform the company of his status, we communicated this development to the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) and Federal Ministry of Health. Other colleagues who interacted with the staff have been identified and mandated to isolate immediately while the premises of the terminal have been fumigated. We will continue to support both the staff undergoing treatment and those who are in isolation.
