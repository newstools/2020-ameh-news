Mouka has introduced a #stayhomewithMouka campaign to encourage its consumers to stay safe indoors while they enjoy a range of benefits from the brand. Mouka has also teamed up with the online retailer, Konga.com to ensure that their products are delivered safely to the doorstep of consumers. During this period, consumers are spending more time in bed and Mouka intends to make the stay comfortable and pleasant. The #stayhomewithMouka with Mouka campaign promises to keep consumers engaged and rewarded during this period. To keep consumers engaged, Mouka engaged Ex BBN housemate Tuoyo to take consumers on a fitness journey as exercise is one of the bedrocks for a quality night sleep and wellbeing. Also, Mouka has engaged known Celebrities such as Sola Sobowale and Bolanle Olukanni for live interactions on relevant topics relating to staying engaged during the COVID 19 epidemic. During this period, Mouka will also be supporting new and existing users with Konga grocery vouchers ranging from N2,500 to N10,000 each.Â  Details can be found on their social media platforms.
