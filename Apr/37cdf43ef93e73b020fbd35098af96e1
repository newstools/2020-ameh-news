The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said it was appalling that Buhari failed to offer decisive solutions to protect Nigerians from the deadly pandemic. The party also expressed its disappointment that the president did not offer any post-lockdown stimulus to assist Nigerians in the private sector whose businesses have been crippled by the lockdown and are now faced with the burden of workers’ salaries and business refinancing. The PDP in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, noted that the president did not offer a decisive solution regarding the production of drugs, testing kits, and management of equipment to safeguard Nigerians, despite the huge resources at the disposal of his administration. The party described as saddening that the president did not address the demands by Nigerians to engage competent hands, including indigenous researchers, equipment manufacturers, pharmaceutical, and medical as well as virology experts to infuse home grown therapeutic solutions in the overall effort. “Our party invites Nigerians to observe how countries like Senegal had effectively mobilised their indigenous medical researchers and manufacturers to produce low-cost quick testing kits as well as ventilators while investing massively in the production of drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 patients,” PDP said.
