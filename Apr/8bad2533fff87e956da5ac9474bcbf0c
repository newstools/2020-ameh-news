 Former President Goodluck Jonathan has called on stronger economies and international agencies like the World Health Organisation (WHO) to support the efforts of African nations towards procuring the necessary equipment and kits to enable them to conduct aggressive testing that would make the current lockdown imposed on cities more productive. The former president also appealed to international financing and donor agencies as well as creditor nations to grant palliatives, including debt relief or placing a moratorium on repayments to help weaker nations cope with the economic difficulties brought upon them by the COVID-19 pandemic. Jonathan stated this over the weekend while speaking as a panelist in an international web-based conference organised by the Universal Peace Federation (UPF) with the theme ‘Governance Challenges in the Era of the Coronavirus Pandemic.’ The other panelists included Mr. Stephen Harper, former Canadian Prime Minister, Mr. Sang Hyun Yoon, South Korean parliamentarian, and Dr. Thomas Walsh, UPF Chairman.
