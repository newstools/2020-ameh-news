 Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, has charged contractors working on the dualisation of the Lokoja-Auchi-Benin road to ensure that road users are not subjected to hardship while the work is ongoing. A statement issued by the Ministry of Works on Tuesday said Fashola spoke during an inspection tour of the road. “Contractors are being encouraged to ensure that road users do not face hardship while construction work is going on especially during the rainy season,” the minister said. He assured that thorough work was being done on the road to achieve high quality. “It is not just asphalt that is being laid; the road is being built from under with laterites and stones,” Fashola added.
