The House of Representatives Committee on Aviation has met with the management of the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria and aviation union leaders over the termination of Intelligent Imaging West Africa Limited’s contract as the managers of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport access gate. The meeting was said to have been held on Tuesday headed by the Chairman of the committee, Mr Nnolim Nnaji. The outcome of the meeting has however not been made known. FAAN had on Tuesday terminated the concession of the tollgate of the Lagos airport to its concessionaire following a clash between the agency’s workers and the company on Monday and Tuesday. FAAN workers had on Monday taken over the collection of tolls at the entrance of the MMIA, Lagos, alleging that the firm’s contract with the agency had expired over a year ago.
