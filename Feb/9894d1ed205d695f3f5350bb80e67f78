…. Revenue Growth Hits in Nine Quarter High in Q4  Despite the hardship operating environment in the country, the famous brewery in the country, the Nigerian Breweries plc has reported a net revenue grew of 1.2% y/y in 2019FY but recorded a decline of 4% y/y when compare in Q4 on price and mix gains, with revenue benefiting from slight price increases taken across its premium portfolio in the period.  According to experts at Cordros Research, this is the strongest y/y revenue growth since Q3, 2017, who can beat that.  In response to the performances, Heineken NV (NB’s parent company) in its 2019FY earnings call stated that Heneiken brand and the premium portfolio recorded double-digit volume growth. We note that gains at the gross revenue level were slightly eroded by the higher excise duty expense compared to last year which NB did not report gross revenue and excise duty numbers in its 2019FY results.  Sequentially, net revenue grew 33.3% q/q is an indication of the impact of the price increases and Q4 being a seasonally strong quarter due to the year end with festivities. Also the company’s gross profit margin rose by 288 bps y/y with widened to 40.2% in Q4, 2019. The gross margin recorded was the best Q4 performance in 2 years and was driven by continued productivity gains (COGS declined 3.5% y/y) as well as the continued growth in the high margin premium segment.  OPEX is another positive indicator that rose by 8.9% y/y in Q4, 2019, resulting in an operating expense ratio (OER) of 28.9%.  The breakdown of the result shows a 21.7% y/y increase in Advertising and sales promotions (10.0% of total OPEX) which reflecting its focus on increasing brand visibility – ‘sell-out’ strategy. Other income grew 1.5% y/y on one-off income from Insurance Claim; combined with the improved gross profit, this was enough to offset the rise in OPEX, resulting in EBIT and EBITDA growing by 8.9% y/y and 8.1% y/y, with 11.5% (+82 bps) and 20.9% (+134 bps) margins, respectively.   The Company’s Q4 2019 and 2019FY audited results came to the Nigerian Stock Exchange after the close of market on Friday, and that results submitted show EPS decline of 17.6% y/y in Q4, driven by higher operating expenditure, and significantly higher net finance costs, both of which offset the increase in gross margin.  On the 2019FY, EPS stood at N2.01 declined by 17.1% from 2018FY, in spite of that the board has proposed a final dividend of N1.50 per share, in line which equates to a yield of 2.9% on Friday’s closing price at N51.50 per share.  Elsewhere, net finance costs surged 72.5% following 64.9% increase in finance costs and 74.0% decline in finance income. Higher finance costs were due to the N30 billion worth of commercial papers issued in the year. We also note that total debt, as at Dec-2019, increased by 35.5% to N55.72 billion from N41.13 billion in 2018FY.  NB also recorded much stronger cash generation from its operating cash flow: which up by27.4% above 2018FY, following a significantly reduction in its trade receivables which stood at N21.31 billion compare to N35.15 billion in 2018FY  The Cordros research experts are of their opinion: saying we like that the company continues to record improved (1) improve volumed outturn, (2) productivity, and thus (3) relatively strong gross margins, especially amidst the challenging operating environment. Following further price increases to cover the VAT adjustment, we expect sustained improved performance in Q1-20.  NB’s share price is down 12.7% YTD and the stock is trading on 2020E P/E of 17.3x, a discount to historical average forward P/E of 22.8x.
