 Ogun State Government has thrown its weight behind the Central Bank of Nigeria’s (CBN’s) farmers verification. This is coming ahead of the commencement of the farming season. The CBN has ended the farm mapping exercise for verified Anchor Borrowers’ subscribers across the 20 local government areas. The exercise was aimed at authenticating claims of subscribers as regards farm land areas indicated in their different local government areas. A minimum of one hectare of farmland is expected of each subscriber. Speaking during the exercise, Commissioner for Agriculture Dr. Adeola Odedina said the verification was critical if the farmers are to benefit from the support of the apex bank. Represented by the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Agriculture, Dr. Dotun Shorunke, the Commissioner, who led a monitoring team to some local government areas including Abeokuta South, Abeokuta North, Odeda, Yewa-North and Imeko-Afon Local of the state, assured the verified subscribers of the provision of improved seedlings for optimum outputs, just as their farms also would be insured against unforeseen circumstances. He   expressed satisfaction with the level of clearing done in Apojula, Odeda Local Government Area on the land to be allotted to cassava farmers who do not have farmlands but have been verified for the Anchor Borrowers’ Programme. He  added that the scheme was targeted at capturing 23,000 cassava farmers across the 20 LGAs in the state. The Project Manager,  Ogun State Agricultural Development Programme (OGADEP),  and Secretary of the Anchor Borrowers’ Programme, Ms Taiwo Ayansanwo, said the scheme was meant to help farmers increase their capacities. She encouraged more farmers to embrace the scheme to reduce poverty. She assured that the scheme will not be limited to cassava farmers, but all other aspects of the agricultural value-chain. ‘’We will soon be training the farmers on how to achieve good agronomy for maximum farm produce,” she assured.
