A former senator, Buruji Kashamu, has said tax revenue from lotto industry can take Nigeria out of its economic woes if properly harnessed. Kashamu, who represented Ogun East Senatorial District in the eighth senate, said this during an interview with journalists in Lagos on Saturday. According to him, the failure of lotto industry operators to be faithful in the payment of taxes and levies to the coffers of government was partly responsible for the inability of government to be up to date in infrastructure development. He said, “I have it on good authority that all the promoters ought to have paid N600bn to the Federal Government and its agencies but they have only paid N9bn in the last 14 years.” The former legislator, who has interest in Western Lotto, said he was in support of the effort to sanitise the lotto business.
