 The Senate Committee on Federal Character Commission and Inter- Governmental Affairs said on Monday that it would soon begin the probe of the alleged sales of the Nigerian Ports Authority  appointment letters. The panel alleged that an employment letter of the NPA was being sold for as much as N3m by some officials of the Federal Character Commission. The Chairman of the Committee, Senator Danjuma La’ ah, who stated this in an interview with journalists in Abuja, vowed to get to the root of the matter. La’ah said his panel was in the possession of evidence involving a man who bought the NPA job for N3m from the FCC. He noted with great concern that his panel had been inundated with “underhand dealings that have been going on at FCC.” He said, “The Senate Committee on Federal Character Commission has been investigating and we are doing everything possible to unravel those behind sales of jobs at the FCC. “I got reports from different people on sales of jobs going on at the Federal Character Commission. “Appointment into government offices are now for sale at the Federal Character Commission. It is real. “Someone has forwarded to me a text message which is in my phone that he purchased the Nigeria Ports Authority job from the Federal Character Commission at N3m. “This is shocking. It makes my heart bleed. I am so sad and I am going to take a drastic action in this case. “If the committee finds out this is what they have been doing, we are not going to take it lightly with them.” He said the development was an embarrassment to the society and even to the regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari(retd.).
