 Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, on Friday presented a total sum of N1.2bn bonds to some retired workers, who are on Contributory Pension Scheme. The governor, who presented the bonds to the beneficiaries at an event marking this year’s Cultural Day, held at the state government secretariat, Abere, Osogbo, said his administration would continue to put smiles on the faces of all categories of workers and retirees in the state. Oyetola described the pensioners as a significant population and elderly citizens who had contributed significantly and meritoriously to the upliftment of the state. He said, “Your welfare is of paramount importance to us, which is why, even in the face of limited resources, we have lived up to our word to pay your gratuity and pension as retired workers and the salaries of the serving workers. “About two days ago, we released the sum of N50m for the payment of gratuities of retired workers under the old pension scheme. Today, we are here to further fulfil our promise to enhance your welfare. “We shall release the sum of N550m for the payment of terminal benefits of some retired workers under the Contributory Pension Scheme, as well as another sum of N647m  under the scheme for retired local government employees and the elementary school teachers in the state.” The governor expressed appreciation to them for their commitment to the service of the state  and assured that his administration  would continue to cater to the welfare of workers. He said, “It is in fulfilment of our resolve to pursue your interest without fail that we convened the Osun Economic and Investment Summit. We recognise that under the belly of our soil and in the minds of our hard working people lay the wealth of our state and the prosperity of our people. We shall continue to labour to unlock these potential for your welfare.”
