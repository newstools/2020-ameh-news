Following the allegation of collapse online application portal of SONCAP by the National Vice Chairman of Association Of Nigerian Licenced Customs Agents (ANLCA) Dr. Collins Kayode Farinto, the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) has debunked the claims describing it as a blatant lies saying only non compliant shippers suffers SONCAP pre-shipment automation.\  According to the statement from the office of the Director General, Osita Aboloma signed by the Head, Public Relations, Mr. Bola Fashina, the portal was recently upgraded to ensure optimal performance, enhance a seamless operation and more efficient service delivery to customers and stakeholders alike. He disclosed that some of the advantages the upgraded SONCAP portal offers are:
– a one-stop-shop that provides clients opportunity to apply, track application, send messages to SON and receive responses as well upload evidence of payments seamlessly
– profile the work done and documents used for application are available on Clients’ dashboard
– No more Tax Identification Number (TIN) error
– No more mistakes in company name etc. While agreeing to a recent challenge in transmitting approved and activated SONCAP certificates to the National trade portal, Fashna said such challenge was not peculiar to SON alone but all other trade related agencies from January 22, 2020. He stated that the issue has since been rectified on the national trade portal and all pending SONCAP certificates transmitted to the Nigerian Integrated Customs Information System (NICIS) portal as at February 1, 2020. On the claim that imports were accumulating demurrage as a result of the gap, Fashina explained that the SONCAP is a pre-shipment process, stressing that only non compliant importers, who apply for the certificates after the arrival of their consignments are crying foul. He said some importers who brought in about 182 containers into the country without following the pre-shipment conformity assessment process are those trying to circumvent established procedure. According to him, such consignments would naturally be subjected to scrutiny, seized if found to be substandard while those behind them would face prosecution. He advised importers to follow the import procedures strictly by ensuring that they process their product and SONCAP certificates offshore rather than looking for short cuts after the consignments might have arrived Nigeria.
