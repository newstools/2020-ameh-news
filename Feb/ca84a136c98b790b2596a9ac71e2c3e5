 The Nigeria Employers’ Consultative Association has condemned moves by the Federal Government to borrow N2tn from the Pension Fund. The government had indicated the intention to borrow from the fund to augment infrastructural development in the country. NECA said the move was unnecessary and an attempt to frustrate the future of contributors. The Director-General of NECA, Dr Timothy Olawale,  advised the government to utilise the recovered Abacha loot and other recovered/forfeited stolen funds for infrastructural development and not dip its hands into the pension fund.
