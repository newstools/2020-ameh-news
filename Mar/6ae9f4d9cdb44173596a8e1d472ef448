The duo of Jenny Koko and Louis (Jelo) have been checked out of Ultimate Love, proudly Naija reality television show, after an exciting and entertaining experience at the Love Pad.The couple became the third couple to leave the Love Pad on Sunday after they received the least number of votes out of the four nominated couples from the voting public last week. They, however, went home with N100,000 and other beautiful gifts after they declined to play the Jeopardy game on stage. Meanwhile, five couples were nominated for possible check-out during the live nomination show on Sunday. The couples as announced by the show’s hosts, Dakore Egbuson-Akande and Oluwaseun Olaniyan, are DoubleChris (Chris and Chris Ville), Jaykech (Jay and Nkechi), Bolar (Bolanle and Arnold), Obiebi (Obichukwu and Ebiteinye), and Iykeresa (Iyke and Theresa). DoubleChris led the pack this week with four nominations, Jaykech had three nominations each; while Bolar, Obiebi and Iykeresa got two nominations respectively. However, Aunty has the power to save one of the couples from possible eviction and the couple will be saved after performing a real-world mission task as chosen by her. The couples selected for the task by Adesuwa Onyenokwe, the show’s Aunty, are Iykeresa and Bolar. The couples with the least number of votes will be evicted during the live check-out show next Sunday. Voting will start on Tuesday at 8 pm and will close on Thursday at 10 pm.
