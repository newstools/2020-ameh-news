The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN)’s position on the Covid-19 Pandemic is that it is expedient that Government provide safety nets for these groups of its public to ensure seamless operations.  Engr Mansur Ahmed, the President of MAN, therefore, suggests the following:         The MAN President pointed out that the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 30, 2020 declared the outbreak of Coronavirus otherwise known as COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Since then, it becomes imperative for stringent actions to be taken by the World and indeed, Nigeria to help its citizens adjust and cope with the pandemic. As the voice of manufacturers interest in Nigeria, the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) recognizes the efforts of Government from the point Nigeria recorded its first case on February 25,2020 which was further confirmed on the 27th. It is also comforting to note that the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) are not resting on their oars through drafting of  the different protocols for safety disseminated to the general public all in a bid to ensure the safety of citizens.  Engr Ahmed said that on our part as a group, in a bid to address the potential impact of the virus on the Nigerian economy, MAN has advised members to ensure they sensitize and educate their workers on compliance with National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) guidelines;  and provide requisite facilities and supplies for the prevention of COVID-19 in line with extant guidelines of the NCDC.  “Given the fundamental role manufacturers will be playing at a time like this, they have been encouraged to sustain ongoing operations to avoid reduction or shut down of production activities; and scale up their production especially of essential commodities such pharmaceuticals, consumables, sanitary and hygiene products needed to curtail the spread of the virus (COVID-19).
