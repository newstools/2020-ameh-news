Director-General of the agency, Mojisola Adeyeye, made the announcement on Friday at the NAFDAC headquarters in Lagos. She, however, pointed out that NAFDAC is not approving Chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19 but for clinical trials to find treatment for the pandemic like her counterpart, US which endorsed the same yesterday. “In the case of Chloroquine, it has been demonstrated in the literature and with clinical research which is still ongoing, that Chloroquine is superior to the Placebo. “NAFDAC is not approving Chloroquine as a product that has can be used for Coronavirus because there is no submission to us for registration but because it is under clinical trials, NAFDAC approves medicines meant for clinical trials. “Therefore the medicine is being approved just for the clinical trials,” Adeyeye said. She, therefore, called on experts and researchers that are interested in doing a clinical trial on Chloroquine to approach approved outlets. “Right now, we have asked one company to make a batch of Chloroquine for the purpose of clinical trial,” Adeyeye disclosed.
