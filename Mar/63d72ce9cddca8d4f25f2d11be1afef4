The Joint Admissions Matriculation Board, JAMB, Nigeria’s entrance examination board for tertiary-level institutions, Thursday, said it did not rescheduled the 2020 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination, UTME as been rumoured. This coming against the backdrop of report making wave in the social media that with several States in the country suspending gathering of more than 50 person, the board has rescheduled some of the 2020 UTME for next week.  The rumour reads: “All UTME Candidates whose exam was dated between Monday, 23rd March and Saturday, 4th April 2020 should take note that their exam has been rescheduled for Tomorrow, Friday, 20th March and Saturday, 21st March 2020. “You are expected to reprint your Slip to know your new date.  Kindly inform others.” However, the Spokesperson for the board, Mr. Benjamin Fabian in a chat with media said that, JAMB did not move any examination as scheduled. “Candidates should disregard the rumour and prepare for their examination as stated,” Fabian added.
