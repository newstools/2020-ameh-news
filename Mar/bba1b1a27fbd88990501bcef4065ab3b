…As Corporation Assures of Nationwide Product Availability In its bid to ensure that the Presidential directive on the lockdown of some states is adhered without concerns about availability of petroleum products, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has announced the activation of measures to guarantee seamless distribution of fuel across the country throughout the period of the lockdown and beyond. Mr. Musal Lawal, Managing Director, Petroleum Products Marketing Company (PPMC) A press release by the Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division of the Corporation, Dr. Kennie Obateru, quoted the Managing Director of Petroleum Products Marketing Company, NNPC’s downstream subsidiary, Mr. Musa Lawan, as saying that the PPMC workforce has been mobilized to provide loading services throughout the period of the envisaged lockdown. “If you recall, two days ago, the Group Managing Director of NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, stated that we have 60 days sufficiency of Premium Motor Spirit. That is very correct. As a matter of fact, we have about 2.68 billion litres of petrol in-country and in marine storage.
