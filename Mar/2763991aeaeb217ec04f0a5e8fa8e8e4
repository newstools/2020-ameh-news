 The ban covers wedding receptions, parties and all kinds of social events including religious services. The governor also announced the closure of all public schools in the state effective March 23, 2020 while all state owned institutions of higher learning were ordered shut immediately. Sanwo-Olu announced the ban in a briefing Friday and asked residents to avoid large gatherings for whatever reason. “This means that gatherings around our event centres and clubs, both day clubs and night clubs, bars etc are also affected by this directive. We must learn from other examples in South Korea and Singapore. Disease spread largely through gatherings both at religious and other spheres,” he said. The governor directed the police to strictly enforce the directive. Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital has the highest number of confirmed cases of the COVID-19. Nigeria presently has so far confirmed 12 cases of the deadly disease with Lagos accounting for 10. Public health analysts sampled by THEWILL believe there are definitely more people infected by the virus in the country but that testing has not been easily available.
