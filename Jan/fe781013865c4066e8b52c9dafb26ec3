 The Nigeria Meteorological Agency (NiMet) has predicted that Nigerians will experience near-normal to above-normal rainfall across the country in 2020. With the prediction, the earliest onset date of rainfall is expected to occur on February 24 in Southsouth states, while the northern states are predicted to experience their onset on June 2. The earliest cessation date is expected on September 26 around Katsina and Sokoto states while the latest cessation date is expected on December 28 in the Niger Delta region. It was also predicted that areas where flooding were experienced in the previous years will experience flooding at the peak of the rainfall this year. Farmers were also advised to avoid early planting, as there would be false onset of rain, to avoid losses. This was part of information given to the public on Monday in Abuja during this year’s Seasonal Rainfall Prediction (SRP) with the theme: The Role of Climate Information for Decision Making in a Changing Climate. At the unveiling of this year’s rainfall pattern, the Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, said: “A normal to above normal rainfall is expected generally in the country. It is expected that total rainfall amounts will range from 400 millimetres (mm) in the North to about 3,000 mm in the South.” Giving further highlight on this year’s rainfall pattern, he said.”
