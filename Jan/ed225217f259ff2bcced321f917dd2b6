The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has retained the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) at 13.5 percent, but increased the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) from 22.5 to 27.5 percent .Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele, disclosed this during a press conference on Friday at the end of a two-day MPC meeting held at the apex bank’s headquarters in Abuja. He explained that nine of the committee members voted to retain the MPR and increase CRR owing to the rise in inflation. “The committee by a decision of nine members voted to alter cash reserve requirement by 500 basis point from 22.5 to 27.5 percent; while leaving all other policy parameters constant. The AmehNews recalled that the fluctuations in the inflation and growth of the country depend on CRR ratio. CRR is the primary tools in the economy, which reduces the bank’s lending capacity and manages the money flow in the market. “MPC voted to retain the MPR at 13.5 percent, and retain the asymmetric corridor of +200 and -500 basis point around the MPR; and lastly, retain the liquidity ratio at 30 percent,” he stressed. He added that the committee maintained MPR essentially for sustainable support to growth before any possible adjustment. He stated, “This would enable policy to react suitably to development as they occur in the near term. “Retaining the current policy position provides an avenue to evaluating the impact of the heterodox monetary and financial policies to support lending by the banking industry without altering policy rate.” According to the governor, the committee noted that it will reduce the speed of economic recovery, relative to loosening, exert a drag on output growth as Deposit Money Banks continue to utilise bond sales, instead of engaging in financial intermediation to the private sector.
