 Nathan Sharibu, father of the teenage Christian girl, Leah, said he had received the news of his daughter’s reported motherhood status while still under captivity with all pleasure. Sharibu, who responded to inquiries from our correspondent, said “I remain undaunted because, if that is the will of God; then, I receive it with all pleasure.” He said despite the psychological trauma occasioned by the news report of his daughter now being a mother, Sharibu added he would not allow it to stop him from “going to church on Sunday (yesterday).” Sharibu, however, said he was saddened about the “conspiracy” over his daughter’s whereabouts. This, he argued, was because neither the Federal Government nor Ahmad Salkida, who allegedly broke the news, could claim ignorance of his daughter’s whereabouts. He said, “ I have been receiving calls from last night, if that is the will of God, it is well. Whatever they have done I receive it with all pleasure. The government knows Leah’s whereabouts. “I repeat it; the government knows Leah’s whereabouts, as well as Ahmed Salkida. But whatever it is, I don’t have anything more to say, than to receive it (the condition of Leah) with all pleasure.” Salkida, a journalist known to have very reliable sources within the Islamist Boko Haram terrorist group, had revealed that Leah, one of the abducted  Dapchi schoolgirls still under the captivity of the group, “is now a mother.” Salkida, who is in exile in Dubai following Nigerian military’s allegation that had ties with the Islamist sect,  made the disclosure to the President of the EYN (Church of the Brethren), Reverend Joel Billi. Billi, who made this known to our correspondent, said Salkida made the disclosure after he broke the news of the beheading of the Chairman, Christian Association of Nigeria in the Michika Local Government Area of Adamawa State, Lawan Andimi, by Boko Haram.
