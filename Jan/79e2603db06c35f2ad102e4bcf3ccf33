 The Federal Government is planning a 10-year successor plan to replace the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan. The Minister of State, Budget and National Planning, Clem Agba, said this while receiving the Japanese Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Nigeria, Yutaka Kikuta, in his office. He said a new economic blueprint for the country was imperative following the winding down of the ERGP this year. Agba, according to a statement from the ministry, said the Federal Government had made tremendous progress in its effort to reposition the economy of the country. He said, “The National Development Plan will be a 10-year plan for Nigerians. “It will be broken down into two five-year medium-term plans, from which the annual budgets would be drawn.” Kikuta commended the government on its economic policies and priorities, saying that Nigeria was on the right track to economic recovery and sustainability.
