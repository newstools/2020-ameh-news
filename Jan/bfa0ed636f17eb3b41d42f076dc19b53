 The police yesterday stepped up security in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), and its environs as protests over the United States’ killing of an influential Iranian General and Head of the Qods Force, Quasam Soleimani, seeped into the country. The Inspector General of Police, Mr. Mohammed Adamu, had on Sunday put all members of the police high command on the alert to prevent a possible breakdown of law and order following the killing of Soleimani. Members of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN) generally known as the Shiites, suspected of being affiliated to Iran, protested the United States’ last Friday drone strike that Killed Soleimani, burning the US flags during the demonstration in Abuja. Their protest was in defiance of the appeal by the Nigerian Supreme Council of Islamic Affairs (NSCIA) against any planned solidarity march by Muslim youths across the country over the crisis. The council pleaded with Muslim youths not to allow their emotions to becloud them to the dangers ahead.
Amid the tension in Nigerian over the Soleimani killing, the US has warned its citizens in Nigeria to be on the alert and take care of their personal security.
