Raw-Materials Sourcing The Executive summary of the economic review for the first half of 2019 by the group under the aegis of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) which was sent to the AmehNews stated that Local raw-materials utilization in the manufacturing sector has maintained downward trends since the first half of 2017 when the Central Bank of Nigeria commenced policy intervention in the official forex market. The relatively more available forex resulting from the intervention may have been rubbing off negatively on backward integration agenda as firms prefer to import raw-materials as against inward looking. However, in the first half of 2019, local sourcing of raw-materials in the manufacturing sector increased marginally to 57.0 percent from 56.87 percent recorded in the corresponding half of 2018, representing 0.13 percentage point increase over the period.  It however declined by of 6.7 percentage point when compared with 63.7 percent recorded in the preceding half.  The retained average performance of local raw-materials utilization in the period is due principally to poor access to credit and adequate economic infrastructure needed inward development of local inputs.  According to analysis based on sectoral groups shows that local sourcing of raw-materials appreciated in some sector, while it declined in some others.   For instance, in the Food, Beverage and Tobacco group, local raw-materials utilization stood at 62.9 percent in the first half of 2019, representing 0.95 percentage point increase from 61.95 percent recorded in the same half in 2018. It however, fell by 5.6 percentage point when compared with 68.5 percent recorded in the preceding half. Similarly, utilization of local raw-materials in the Domestic and Industrial Plastic, Rubber & Foam sector stood at 58.3 percent in the first half of 2019, representing 2.81 percentage point increase from 55.49 percent recorded in the same half in 2018. It however fell by 5.9 percentage point when compared with 64.2 percent recorded in the preceding half. Likewise, utilization of local raw-materials in the Chemical and Pharmaceutical sector stood at 58.3 percent in the first half of 2019, representing 2.81 percentage point increase from 55.49 percent recorded in the same half of 2018. It however fell by 5.9 percentage point when compared with 64.2 percent recorded in the preceding half. Contrary to expectation, utilization of local raw-materials in the Textile, Wearing Apparel, Carpet, Leather & Leather Footwear sector stood at 54.6 percent in the first half of 2019, representing 8.09 and 3.0 percentage point decline from 62.69 percent and 57.6 percent recorded in the same half of 2018 and the preceding half respectively. However, in the same period under review, local sourcing of raw materials declined across some industrial zones safe for Ikeja, Apapa and Abuja Zones etc. for instance, in Kano Bompai Zone, local sourcing of raw-materials stood at 62.33 percent from 73 percent recorded in the corresponding half of 2018 and the 72.69 percent of the preceding half; thus representing 10.67 and 10.36 percentage points decline over the period respectively. While Local sourcing of raw-materials in Ogun zone stood at 56.98 percent in the first half of 2019, indicating 0.32 and 14.24 percentage points decline from 57.3 percent and 71.22 percent recorded in the same half of 2018 and the preceding half of respectively. Also in Rivers/Bayelsa Zone, local sourcing of raw-materials stood at 52.33 percent from 65.9 percent recorded in the corresponding half of 2018 and the 59.69 percent of the preceding half; thus representing 13.57 and 7.36 percentage points decline over the period respectively. Nevertheless, In Ikeja zone, local sourcing of raw-materials increased to 58.6 percent in the first half of 2019 from 52.2 percent recorded in the corresponding half of 2018; thereby indicating 6.4 percentage point increase over the period. It however decreased by 4.74 percentage point when compared with 63.34 percent recorded in the preceding half.
