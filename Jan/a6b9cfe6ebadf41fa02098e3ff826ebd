 Nigeria has the lowest penetration of liquefied petroleum gas, popularly called cooking gas, despite being rich in gas resources, the Federal Government has said. The Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, who said this during a television interview, also stated that the Federal Government was working towards the production of Compressed Natural Gas as an alternative fuel to Premium Motor Spirit this year. Sylva said, “The gas sector will definitely grow. Nigeria is described as a gas territory with oil in it. Unfortunately, we have not taken advantage of our gas resources. “All the gas we have found in Nigeria was found while looking for oil, not looking for gas. We are going to have some targeted exploration for gas.” He added, “We also want the people of Nigeria to have an alternative to PMS. We want to see how gas can be converted to CNG. “And also we are trying to improve the LPG penetration. Unfortunately, Nigeria has the lowest LPG penetration in the world. We are very rich in gas. This year we are going to focus on this area.” Sylva stated that although the Petroleum Industry Bill had made several trips to the National Assembly without translating into law, 2020 would mark its last trip to the lawmakers. The minister expressed optimism that the PIB would be passed this year based on the cordial relationship between the legislature and the executive. The minister also disclosed that the rehabilitation of the Port Harcourt refinery would begin in the first quarter of 2020. He said that the construction of the Ajaokuta, Kaduna and Kano gas pipeline project would begin this year.
