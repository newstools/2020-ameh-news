As human resource experts continue to seek pathways to creating an innovative, successful and sustainable workforce, foremost provider of innovative payment and human capital management technology solutions and services, SystemSpecs, has urged Nigerian businesses to better position their firms to become more attractive to top talent. Speaking during a panel session tagged, “Bridging the Fintech Talent Gap in Nigeria”, at the recently held Lagos Fintech Week, Mujib Ishola, the Head of Engineering at SystemSpecs, stated that irrespective of the field in which they work, top talents want to be associated with the best organisations. “Every organisation seeks to attract and retain sought-after talents. On the other hand, the talented individual’s decision to work with an organisation is based on the perceived value the individual believe they can bring into the organisation and how it will be appreciated. This is more important than money,” Ishola said. According to him, to build a top-notch workforce, businesses need to treat their current employees well, project a powerful brand, and leverage the internet and social media to put information about them out there.
