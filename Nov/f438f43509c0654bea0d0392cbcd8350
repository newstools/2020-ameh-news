The Federal Government and the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation are working to cut down energy consumption by industries in Nigeria. Both parties made this public in Abuja on Friday at the inauguration of the project steering committee for the execution of the project on improving Nigeria’s industrial energy performance and Resource Efficient Cleaner Production. The Minister of State for Environment, Sharon Ikeazor, said the committee would execute the project in selected small, medium and large scale industries through programmatic approaches and promotion of innovation in clean technology solutions. She said, “The objective of this project is to accelerate the adoption of industrial energy efficiency and to improve enterprise environmental performance under the wider umbrella of Resource Efficiency and Cleaner Production. “Initial manufacturing industries in which the energy management systems, energy system optimisation and RECP methodologies will be introduced, piloted and demonstrated have been selected in the steel, petrochemical, textiles, food and beverage sub-sectors in Nigeria.” Ikeazor said the steering committee members would bring their technical expertise in guiding the project to a successful conclusion. “To protect ourselves and the environment from the harmful effects of inefficient production processes, there is the need to encourage best practices in our industrial processes and its success requires the participation of all stakeholders,” the minister stated. She added, “The general adoption of the cleaner production strategy can alleviate the serious problems of climate change, air and water pollution, global warning, land degradation among others. Hence the successful implementation of this project is a priority.” On his part, the Country Representative and Regional Director, UNIDO, Jean Bakole, said the project would make Nigerian industries develop an expert base which could be exported to other African countries.
