 Nigeria is to take “urgent steps” following a viral video showing the forced closure of shops belonging to Nigerian traders in Ghana. Foreign Affairs Minister Geoffrey Onyeama made the announcement in a tweet, as he expressed his government’s “dismay”: It comes just months after a major diplomatic row in which a building in the Nigerian embassy compound in Ghana was demolished. The video in question shows a Nigerian man speaking to security agents locking up his shop in Ghana. The man claimed in the video that he was asked to pay $1m (£750,000) as tax. Authorities in Ghana dispute this, saying foreigners are only allowed to open a business in Ghana if they invest $1m. A pressure group, the Human Rights Writers Association, has called on the Nigeria government to retaliate against Ghanaian businesses in Nigeria. Some Nigerians are questioning the rationale behind Ghana’s imposition of conditions, considering agreements on free trade and movement reached by the regional body, the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas).
