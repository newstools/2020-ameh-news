The release of the fund was contained in a document by the Commission which stated that the amount released would cover the payment of four months arrears. PenCom said it was limited in the payment of retirees’ accrued rights as it could not force the Federal Government to comply with the new contribution rate. The commission had said that since the review of the 2004 pension reform Act in which the government’s contribution to workers Retirement Savings Account was upgraded from 15 percent to 18 percent, the Federal Government was yet to commence its implementation as its contribution to employees’ RSA has remained at 15 percent. But with the Federal Government’s approval, the amount for each retiree will be transferred into their Retirement Savings Account with the Pension Fund Administrators.
