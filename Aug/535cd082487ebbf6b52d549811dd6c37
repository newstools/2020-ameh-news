As reports of Argentine playmaker, Lionel Messi, exiting Barcelona continue to gain grounds, Manchester United has also joined other clubs seeking the services of the Argentine. Reports suggest that Man United and PSG have already expressed their desires to sign the player. If Messi signs for PSG, he would be uniting with former teammates, Neymar, as well as Kylian Mbappe, as the Ligue 1 champions, who lost in the Champions League final on Sunday to Bayern Munich, try to add more firepower to the team. Reports however suggest that United scouts have been in contact with Messi’s representatives, including his father and agent Jorge. Manchester City, which has Pep Guardiola, Messi’s former manager at Barcelona as manager, has also been in touch with Messi as his lawyers push for a release from his Barca contract which is due to expire in 2021, but a clause allows Messi to leave the club at the end of every season if he chooses to.
