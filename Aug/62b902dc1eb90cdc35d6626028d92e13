In efforts to continue to support the BMIA community and keep you abreast of developments regarding the pandemic, we are sharing the following updates and resources.
The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) and the African Risk Capacity (ARC) launched two COVID-19 modelling tools for Africa: COVID-19 Potential Outcomes Scenarios and the COVID-19 Spread Simulation Tool for Africa. The tools will help African Union Member States evaluate the potential magnitude of COVID-19 in their countries and make decisions on appropriate responses to mitigate risks due to the pandemic. Further information can be found here. The World Health Organization (WHO) is increasing support to 11 countries in Africa that have requested assistance as COVID-19 cases and deaths surge. “As the impact of the virus intensifies in a number of hotspots in Africa, so too are WHO’s efforts” said Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. Further information can be found here. A recent study concluded that the spread of COVID-19 would be delayed and reduced if people consistently practiced the 3 W’s: Wear a mask, Wash your hands, and Watch your distance. Bloomberg Philanthropies partner Resolve to Save Lives provides an in-depth review of the 3 W’s and addresses whether the public should wear eye protection to protect against COVID-19 here. Additionally, Resolve to Save Lives released their most recent global science metrics on the pandemic. The full report can be found here.
